How the definition of depression came about, its early treatments and golden era of antidepressants are well defined in the history books. From serendipitous findings in the early 1940s and 50s of MAOI and TCAs to the well thought, strategised design of SSRIs in the 1970s, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy, for depression paved the way to treat many people with this diagnosis. 

This project is looking at how these treatments that have been developed for treating depression as a whole effect suicidality, which is a major symptom of depression. 

The Bible - The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) on the treatment and management of depression has provided a great guide on how to define depression (in this day and age), official ICD10 diagnoses, and current recommended (and expected to be used when relevant) therapies.
